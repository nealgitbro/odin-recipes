    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Season the chicken breasts generously on both sides with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for 3-5 minutes on each side or until browned.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the chicken to a baking dish coated with cooking spray. 
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the rosemary, butter, garlic, chicken broth and lemon juice. Pour the butter mixture over the chicken.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Bake time may vary depending on the thickness of your chicken breasts. The chicken is done when it reads at least 165 degrees F on a meat thermometer.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon the sauce on the bottom of the baking dish over the chicken, then sprinkle with parsley and serve. Garnish with lemon slices and rosemary sprigs if desired.
