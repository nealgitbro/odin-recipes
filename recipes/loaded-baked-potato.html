    <h2><strong>Description:</strong> </h2>
    <p>A loaded baked potato is a whole potato that's baked in the oven until it's tender and crispy, and is often served with toppings like butter, cheese, sour cream, bacon, and chives.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
        <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced chives</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded cheddar, divided</li>
        <li>6 slices cooked crispy bacon, crumbled, divided</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 400Â°. Prick potatoes all over with a fork or sharp knife. Drizzle with oil, then tightly wrap in foil.
        </li>
        <li>Bake potatoes until a knife can be easily inserted into center, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Unwrap potatoes and cut lengthwise slits in the top of each. Carefully scoop out flesh from center of each potato into a medium bowl. Add white scallion parts, butter, chives, sour cream, half of cheddar, and half of bacon; season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon filling back into each potato, mounding on top. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Continue to bake potatoes until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Top with green scallion parts and remaining bacon.
        </li>
    </ol>
